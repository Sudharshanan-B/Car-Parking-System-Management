# Car-Parking-System-Management
With ever increasing traffic in our country it becomes difficult to plan to go outing in public placed mainly due to parking space problem
This Project solves the problem by showing how many parking space are available at that particular time

This is achieved by Reducing the counter when each car enters.
This reduction of counter is done by proximity sensonr that is when a car passes the near proximity sensor will send a high signal to arduino thus sensed by arduino and the counter is decreased and displayed in lcd
